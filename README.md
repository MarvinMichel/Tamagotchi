# Tamagrootchi

An updated version of my first project. Since my first project I've grown a lot as a developer and I wanted to implement the new knowledge I've gained. That's why I decided to look back at where I started and rebuild the whole application. The old version used Lottie.js to move the SVG with JSON data. Version 2.0 works with GSAP to make it look a lot smoother. The app is created with React, so I could practice and get used to this framework. It makes use of React-Hooks, React-Modal and the Fecth-API.

## Concept

The application is a Tamagotchi of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy character 'Groot'. The application has three buttons to control Groot with. The info button will open a modal, that displays information about Groot which is retrieved from the [Superhero API](https://superheroapi.com/index.html). The play button will make Groot dance on 'Mr Blue Sky' (the intro song of Guardians of the Galaxy 2). The third button makes Groot say 'I am Groot (hello)' to you.
