# Tamagotchi
A Tamagotchi mini game of Marvels 'Groot'. Build with Vanilla JS and JSON.

This was my first time creating someting with JavaScript. With the Lottie player and Adobe After Effects with the Bodymovin plugin, I've made an animation for Groot. The animation exists of JSON files, generated by Bodymovin. It can grow, shrink and dance on music. I fooled around with the fetch API to fetch information about Groot from the WikiPedia API and print it on screen. The game isn't responsive, so only use it full screen on a desktop or laptop.
