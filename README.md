# Tamagrootchi

An updated version of my first project. Since my first project I've grown a lot as a developer and I wanted to implement the new knowledge I've gained. That's why I decided to look back at where I started and rebuild the whole application. The old version used Lottie.js to move the SVG with JSON data. Version 2.0 works with Three.js and a 3D character model.

## Concept

The application is a Tamagotchi of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy character 'Groot'. The application has three buttons to control Groot with. On the right you can find an info-button that will open a modal to displays information about Groot, which is retrieved from the [Superhero API](https://superheroapi.com/index.html).

## What you need
* A 3D model for the character with animations.
* An API-token from the Superhero API.
* The dependencies listed below.
>ðŸ’¡ You can download a 3D model or create one yourself with Blender or such software. I've got mine from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/groot-7e69fddb8e6d4955827bfbcbaf2e83b8) thanks to [Chemaron](https://sketchfab.com/chemaron). The animations are added with [Adobe Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/).
